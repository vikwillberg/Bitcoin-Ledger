# Bitcoin Ledger Project

## Overview
The Bitcoin Ledger Project is a Python-based application designed to simulate a Bitcoin ledger system. It processes and analyzes Bitcoin transactions, providing insights into account balances, transaction histories, and blockchain dynamics.

## Features
- Load and parse transaction data from JSON files.
- Simulate blockchain operations and account management.
- Display transaction details and account balances.
- (Add any other unique features of your project here.)

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone [URL to your repository]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install required Python packages. (List any required packages or provide a `requirements.txt` file.)
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**: 
   - Modify the `config.json` file as needed for configuration settings.
   - Ensure `transactions.json` is in the data directory with sample transaction data.

## Usage
1. **Run the Main Script**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the application.
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interacting with the Ledger**: (Provide instructions on how users can interact with the ledger, such as entering account numbers or viewing transaction details.)
